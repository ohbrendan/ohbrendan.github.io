## How It Works

### Introduction

### Idea Pitch
At this part, we will encourage participants to share their ideas they’ve already got on the stage. All participants will listen to their speech and find the most interesting one.

### Team Forming
Participants will go to find the owners of ideas and form teams.

### Making Simple Samples
At this part, all formed team will start building the prototype of their ideas. Our mentors will give advice about how to develop an idea. However, where on earth will the idea go totally depends on the members of the team themselves. We encourage teams to build prototypes, for example, if you want to make an app, draw it on paper!
