## The Scala Documentation Site

Your main entry point into online documentation on Scala is the official documentation site, [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org/). It contains a growing number of articles, guides and tutorials. The following list highlights some of the most important documents, but the doc site contains much more than that!

## Distincts
Waiting to be formed.

## Map
Waiting to be created.

## Species
Waiting to be explored.

<!-- ## Research

Scala is also a very useful language to do research on/in. You can find Scala-related publications at the
[LAMP research page](http://lamp.epfl.ch/publications). Other Scala-related research material can be found on the
[Scala Days](http://days2012.scala-lang.org/) website and the [Scala2013](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~hmiller/scala2013/) workshop website. For an in-depth view of the technical details of the language, you may also find of interest the [Scala Language Specification]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/archive/nightly/pdfs/ScalaReference.pdf).
