  <figcaption>John Lennon, in "Imagine"</figcaption>
  <pre><code>Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace

You, you may say 
I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world
</code></pre>

  <h3>Imagination is Reality</h3>
  <p>In Oh Brendan, <i>imagination</i> is more important than <code>Reality</code></p>
<p>Thanks to the ancient and mysterious technology, we treasure <i>imagination</i>. And we cannot live without it.
